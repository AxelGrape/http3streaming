can we use an existing videoplayer if it is ontop of mvfast? or do we have to implement the vidoeplayer our selfs?
can he fix a server for us? maybe

if we do the client and server from scratch we might not have to do the live streaming part, it depends on how easy it is to implement the videoplayer into the project.
